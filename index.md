# Welcome

## About Me
Hi, my name is Krish Suchak, and I am a third year undergraduate at the University of Chicago pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I love solving programming challenges, lifting weights, and playing Super Smash Bros Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube.

## Projects
Currently, I am working on a project based on analyzing the performance of any given portfolio invested in both the traditional stock market as well as cryptocurrencies.

You can see my dashboard on the Live tab and a predictive model on the Stats page:
